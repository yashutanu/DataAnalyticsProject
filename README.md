# DataAnalyticsProject
In computer science, an expected outcome of a student's education is programming skill. We conducted survey among our college students via google form. . Our goal is to analyze whether learning online coding, winning in online contests, working on projects helps in getting internship and good grades. We could able to find out the main attributes which are responsible for getting into internship. We visualized  our data by plotting pie charts and bar plot.We could predict whether a student get into internship based on number of contest won,online resource,age ,grades of algorithm and data structure course and projects by using SVM and na√Øve bayes models.

We conducted an online survey among our college students via google forms. There are 117 records which contains 17 attributes. The attributes are user_id,gender,age,preferred programming language,known programming languages,way of learning,preferred contest,goal of learning,online resource,role, internship, number of contest won, number of hours spent,workshop rating,list of projects done, grades in algorithms,data structure.
